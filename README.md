This is a puzzle game in Unity that I created for Global Games Jam 2018. 

I have uploaded it to demonstrate the advantages of creating a system that "reads" levels from ASCII maps. It allows a very rapid prototyping of levels created from prefab assets! 

Feel free to play about with it, create more levels, or chastise me for my odd code choices (48 hours of work can lead to crazy decisions), feel free!
